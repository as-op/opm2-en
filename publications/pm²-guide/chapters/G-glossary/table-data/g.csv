Governance,"Governance refers to the act of governing and is therefore concerned with how decisions are made. Governance is a process of developing a more strategic approach to projects/programmes in order to use resources and investments more efficiently and to ensure that business needs are supported by efficient tools. This process is performed by the organisation’s governance bodies (See Appropriate Governance Body, AGB). PM² describes project-level governance and includes a project governance model, project lifecycle, and related processes and artefacts."
