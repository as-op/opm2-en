Pareto Chart Pareto Diagram Pareto Analysis,"The purpose of the Pareto Chart is to categorise (highlight) the cumulative percentage of the contribution of causes (issues, cost, etc.) according to the frequency with which they occur. The Pareto Principle states that generally 80% of effects come from 20% of causes. Using the Pareto Chart enables a focus on the causes that have a high frequency and attempt to find a resolution for them first. This technique is known as Pareto Analysis."
Peer Review,A peer review is an impartial review/evaluation of a project deliverable or artefact carried out by an expert or a group of experts working in the domain.
Performing Layer,The Performing Layer is an operational layer and is where most of the project activities are carried out. It is composed of the Business Implementation Group (BIG) and the Project Core Team (PCT).
Phase-Exit Review Checklists,Phase-Exit Review Checklists are spreadsheet-based documents used by the Project Manager (PM) to ensure that all the necessary items are in place before the project proceeds to the next phase or is closed. They are concerned with checking key information in each phase and gathering Lessons Learned.
Phase Gates,"Phase Gates are approval gates during the project lifecycle (Ready for Planning, Ready for Executing, Ready for Closing). They ensure good governance, making sure that project teams seek approval before moving on to the next phase."
Phase Input,"A phase input is any particular artefact, item, product, decision or even information that will be used in the activities of the receiving phase. Phase inputs are usually outputs of a previous phase."
Phase Output,"A phase output is any particular artefact, item, product, decision or even information that is produced during a phase."
Plan,"A plan is a written projection of project activities and resources needed to execute a process, e.g. for risk management, change management or transition. A plan should answer the four basic questions: what, when, how and by whom."
Planned Value (PV),"Planned Value (PV) refers to the amount of cost (monetary units) planned to be consumed until a point in time (e.g. within a reporting period). It is in other words, an approved cost estimate of the resources scheduled, in a time-phased cumulative baseline. Also known as Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS)."
Planning Phase,The Planning Phase is the second phase of a PM² project in which the subject of the project is verified and developed into a workable plan for implementation. The various standard and specific plans for the project are created in this phase.
PM² Mindsets,The PM² Mindsets present attitudes and behaviours which help project teams focus on what is really important in achieving project goals.

Programmes may also include elements of related work outside the scope of its projects.
Programme Management,Programme management is the process of managing several inter-dependent projects to better achieve the programme’s strategic objectives and benefits.
Project,"A project is a temporary organisational structure which is set up to create a unique product or service (output) within certain constraints. Temporary means that every project has a definite beginning and a definite ending. Unique means that the product or service is different in some distinguishing way from existing products and services. Projects are run by people, constrained by limited resources, and planned, executed and controlled. Projects are often critical components of the performing organisations’ business strategy."
Project Change,"A project change is a modification to the project environment (scope, schedule, resources, costs, risks, quality, artefacts, etc.). Possible causes for a change are e.g. a new requirement, an identified issue, a preventive action to reduce the risk level, a decision taken that has an impact on the project’s baseline etc."

It includes information regarding the project scope, cost, time and risks, as well as information such as milestones, deliverables, and project organisation and approach. It is a document initiated by the business sponsor that formally authorises the existence of the project and the project team and provides the Project Manager (PM) with the authority to use organisational resources to staff project activities. The final responsibility for the quality of the Project Charter lies with the Project Manager (PM)."
Project Coordination,"Project coordination describes the process of managing and directing project activities and stakeholders. It includes the allocation of project resources to activities, continuous quality checks of the interim results of work, ongoing communication with all project members, and the motivation of all involved throughout the project through leadership, negotiations, conflict resolution and application of appropriate people management techniques."
Project Core Team (PCT),The Project Core Team (PCT) is a group on the provider side of the project that performs the day-to-day project activities under the coordination of the Project Manager (PM). It plays a key role in the successful completion of the project.
Project Drivers,Project drivers comprise the roles that lead the key activities in each phase of a PM² project. The project drivers differ from phase to phase.
Project-End Report,"The Project-End Report summarises the project experience, performance, Lessons Learned, successful project practices and pitfalls. It is created in the Closing Phase of a PM² project by the Project Manager (PM)."
Project-End Review Meeting,"The Project-end Review Meeting takes place during the project’s Closing Phase. Its aim is to ensure that project members discuss their experience so that lessons learned and best practices are captured. In addition, ideas and recommendations for post-project work should also be discussed. The result of the meeting is documented in the Minutes of Meeting (MoM) and the Project-End Report."
Project Handbook,"The Project Handbook establishes the high-level approach for implementing the project objectives. It is one of the first artefacts created in the Planning Phase and it identifies the project standards, roles & responsibilities, approach and the artefacts to be used."
Project Initiation Request,"The Project Initiation Request is the starting point for documenting a project proposal. It gives a high-level overview of the current situation (needs, problems and opportunities), desired outcomes and the estimated effort, impact, risks, constraints and assumptions associated with the implementation of a solution."
Project Lifecycle,"The Project Lifecycle is the time between the start and the close of the project and includes the Initiating, Planning, Executing and Closing phases. The project lifecycle starts with the Project Initiation Request and ends once the Closing Phase activities are completed and the Project Owner (PO) performs the final acceptance. The formal project closure terminates the project mode and allows the operations mode (if any) to start."
Project Management,"Project management refers to the application of knowledge, skills and techniques to successfully manage work and resources to achieve project objectives and organisational goals."
PM² Project Management Methodology,"PM² is the European Commission’s official project management methodology, developed initially for European Institutions, which aims to enable Project Managers (PMs) to deliver solutions and benefits to organisations through the effective management of project work. It is a methodology created by the European Commission."
Project Management Information System (PMIS),A project management information system (PMIS) is an application system used to support the PM² Methodology and the management of projects in an organisation. It aims to support projects through all PM² phases (supplying templates and instructions) and makes it possible to consolidate information for reporting and monitoring purposes.
Project Management Plans,"Project management plans are used to define project management processes to be applied to the project, such as the Project Change Management Plan, Risk Management Plan, Quality Management Plan, Issues Management Plan, Communications Management Plan and Requirements Management Plan. These plans are part of, or referenced from, the Project Handbook."
Project Manager (PM),The Project Manager (PM) is a role in the project that is appointed by the Project Steering Committee (PSC) to manage the daily progress of the project so as to deliver the outputs within the agreed constraints. The Project Manager (PM) also provides day-to-day management of the Project Core Team (PCT).
Project Mode,"Project mode refers to the work of the project organisation while the project is running. Once the project is completed (closed), it moves to operations mode."
Project Owner (PO),The Project Owner (PO) is the project sponsor and typically holds a management position within the requestor organisation. S/he sets the business goals and provides leadership and strategic direction. The Project Owner (PO) approves the deliverables and ensures that the project meets its goals.

Project Phase,"PM² has four phases: Initiating, Planning, Executing and Closing. The Monitor & Control activities span all four project phases."
Project Progress Report,"The Project Progress Report is an artefact created by the Project Manager (PM) to inform the Project Steering Committee (PSC) on how the project is progressing compared to the baselines and the Project Charter. It covers the status of the deliverables, effort, risks, major issues, actions, achievements and scope changes. The difference between the Project Progress Report and the Project Status Report is that the Project Status Report is sent much more frequently (e.g. every one or two months) and contains just a one-page summary of the Project Status. (See also Project Status Report.)"
Project Quality Assurance (PQA),Project Quality Assurance (PQA) is the role that is responsible for quality assurance and auditing aspects. The role is an optional member of the Project Steering Committee (PSC) and helps the Project Manager (PM) in creating the Quality Management Plan.
Project Reporting,"Project reporting is an activity carried out by the Project Manager (PM) to document and summarise the status of various dimensions of project progress and to communicate this to relevant stakeholders. Project reports typically provide information on scope, schedule, cost and quality, as well as relevant information on risks, issues, project changes and contract management issues."
Project-Specific Plans,"Project-specific plans are used to document and detail the project’s activities and resources based on project needs (e.g. the Project Work Plan, Business Implementation Plan, Transition Plan and Outsourcing Plan)."
Project Stakeholder Matrix,"The Project Stakeholder Matrix lists all the people, groups or organisations involved in the project, and clarifies their roles."
Project Status Report,A Project Status Report is a frequent report (e.g. every 1-2 months) that is sent to the Project Steering Committee (PSC) and contains just a one-page summary of the project status. The frequency and format of this report is defined in the Communications Management Plan. (See also Project Progress Report.)
Project Steering Committee (PSC),The Project Steering Committee (PSC) is responsible for monitoring the correct execution of the project. This group defines the main orientations of the project and coordinates its main tasks. It validates the human and financial resources allocated to the project as well as the main project deliverables. All stakeholder groups should be represented in the Project Steering Committee (PSC).
Project Success Factors (PSF),"Project success factors (PSF) comprise the elements within the structure and context of the project that are necessary to achieve its success. Their presence will not guarantee success, but their absence will significantly increase the probability of failure."
Project Support Office (PSO),"The Project Support Office (PSO) is an organisational body (or entity) providing project management services that may be linked to a specific project or be provided as a horizontal service by the organisation. The responsibilities of a Project Support Office (PSO) can range from providing simple project management support functions to facilitating the link of projects to strategic goals/corporate benefits by sharing resources, methodologies, tools and techniques. Not every organisation has access to such a body."
Project Support Team (PST),"The Project Support Team (PST) is composed of the Project Support Office (PSO), the Project Quality Assurance (PQA) and the Architecture Office (AO). The roles of the Project Support Team (PST) may be specific to a project or be provided as horizontal services by the organisation. This team offers administrative support to the project organisation and defines requirements to projects (e.g. related to reporting, methodology, quality, architecture, etc.)."
Project Variables,"Project variables are the four essential baselined metrics monitored in the Monitor & Control processes: cost, schedule, scope and quality."
Project Work Plan,"The Project Work Plan identifies and organises the project into deliverables, work packages, activities and tasks, needed to achieve the project objectives. It establishes a base from which to estimate the duration of the project, determine the required resources and schedule the work."
Provider Side,"The Provider Side includes the resources of the project that develop and implement the solution, i.e. the Solution Provider (SP), the Project Manager (PM) and the Project Core Team (PCT). In PM² the provider is internal to the organisation and different from any external contractors."
