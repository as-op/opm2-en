Macro-Process,Macro-process refers to a set of processes related to a sub-domain. It corresponds to a grouping of activities based on common business logic. Sometimes the consolidation process corresponds to the sequential execution of many processes.
Major Risk,"A major risk is one that can jeopardise the realisation of project objectives or major milestones and whose risk level (combination of its impact and likelihood) is usually unacceptable and therefore requires risk mitigation, transfer or avoidance."
Managing Layer,"The Managing Layer focuses on day-to-day project realisation by planning, organising, monitoring and controlling project work to produce the intended deliverables and implement them in the business organisation. Members of the Managing Layer report to the Directing Layer. The Managing Layer is composed of the roles of Business Manager (BM) and Project Manager (PM)."
Methodology,"Methodology refers to a written guideline that can be used to produce something. It includes specific components, such as phases, tasks, methods, techniques and tools. PM² is a methodology for Project Management."
Metric,"A metric is a quantifiable value that makes it possible to measure the achievement of a project/service/deliverable/process/activity objective. Metrics should be specific, measurable, actionable, relevant and captured at the right time. They provide important information for project management (e.g. risk, budget, schedule, issues, motivation and quality)."
Milestones,"A milestone refers to a significant point or event in a project that receives special attention. In PM² there are management milestone artefacts that are of particular interest to the Project Steering Committee (PSC). Milestones can also be used to mark key deliverables, control points, the acceptance of final outputs and closing the project."
Minutes of Meeting (MoM),"Minutes of Meeting (MoM) provide a summary of what was discussed in a meeting, including project issues, decisions taken, and risks identified. This document can be used as an input into subsequent meetings."
Mitigation,"Mitigation refers to an action carried out to: (1) lower the likelihood of a risk occurring, and (2) reduce the effect of the risk on the project by minimising its impact if it occurs. (See also Reduce, risk response strategy.)"
Monitor & Control,"Monitor & Control is a group of continuous activities that spans the life of a project. These activities are focused on measuring the correct execution of the project against the agreed baselines using key metrics like costs, time and quality indicators, and taking corrective actions if the execution goes too far off plan."
