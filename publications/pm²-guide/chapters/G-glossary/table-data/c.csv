Customisation,"Customisation of the PM² Methodology refers to defining specific project management parameters in order to address the particularities and needs of the project. It usually involves defining thresholds, scales and other parameters in the PM² defined processes (e.g. defining a risk as major when its impact is deemed as medium or higher), as well as any minor changes to the artefacts (e.g. renaming a section, etc.). Note that changes to the methodology are not considered customisations but tailoring. (See also _Tailoring_ .)"
