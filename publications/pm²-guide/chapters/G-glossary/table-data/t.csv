Tailoring,"Tailoring of the PM² Methodology refers to adapting the methodology to the environment and needs of an organisation. It usually involves tailoring one or more of the four pillars of the methodology (e.g. changing the project governance, adding or removing steps in the PM² defined processes, adding or removing sections in the PM² Artefacts, adding stages to a phase, etc.).
The results of the tailoring of the methodology should be reflected and documented in the PM² Management Plans and in the Project Handbook. Note that significant deviations from the PM² Methodology should be avoided."
Template,"A template is a pre-developed document or file with a pre-set format, used as a starting point for structuring and presenting information so that the format does not have to be recreated each time it is needed."
Threshold,A threshold is a value or interval of values at which a specific action is triggered.
Test Manager,"The Test Manager is the person responsible for collecting and reporting on tests, as well as leading a testing team. The role is assumed by the Project Manager Assistant (PMA) if a Test Manager has not been appointed."
Tolerance,"Tolerance describes the allowable deviation above or below a target for time, cost or other project variable such as quality, scope and risk. If the deviation goes above or below the agreed threshold the current management level escalates the issue to a higher level. Without tolerance, every issue would be escalated immediately and the Project Steering Committee (PSC) would end up running the project."
Top-down (technique),Top-down refers to an approach to estimating project work that begins at the goal level and partitions work down to the finest levels of definition until the participants are satisfied that the project has been defined in adequate detail.
Total Cost of Ownership (TCO),"Total cost of ownership (TCO) defines the estimated cost (both direct and indirect) to deliver the project outcomes.
As a best practice, it is usually calculated for a five-year period, unless specific guidelines suggest otherwise."
Traceability,"Traceability is the ability to verify the history, location or application of an item by means of documented recorded identification."
Training Costs,"Training costs comprise the human resource costs required to provide training to the requestor side (end-users, etc.) or to teams that will support and maintain the solution."
Transfer (risk- response strategy),"Transfer is a risk-response strategy that consists of transferring the risk to a third party (e.g. through insurance or outsourcing activities). This strategy does not relieve the organisation of a risk, but it may reduce the likelihood (e.g. by outsourcing an activity to a specialist party) and/or the impact if the risk occurs. There is always a level of secondary and/or residual risk since the ultimate responsibility for the project risks remains with the organisation."
Transition Management,Transition Management describes the process of managing and controlling the activities that lead the change from the old state to the new state when the deliverables are complete (i.e. delivering the solution to the requestor).
Transition Plan,The Transition Plan defines the pre-requisites of rolling out the new solution. This is useful to ensure a smooth transition from project mode to operations mode.
