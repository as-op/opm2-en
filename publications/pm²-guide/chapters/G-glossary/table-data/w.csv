Work-based Breakdown,Work-based breakdown is a technique used to represent and organise project work by grouping work (e.g. work packages) that is further broken down into smaller portions of work (i.e. tasks).
Work Breakdown,"The work breakdown is part of the Project Work Plan. It consists of a hierarchical description of all work that must be done by the project team to meet the needs of the requestor. The work breakdown is a hierarchical breakdown of the project into smaller and more manageable components such as, deliverables, work packages, activities and tasks. Each lower level offers a finer level of detail of the deliverables and work that together define the project output(s) and the work involved to produce them."
Work Package,A work package is a component of the project work breakdown. It represents a group of project work described in activities and tasks.
