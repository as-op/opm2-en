"Accept
(risk-response strategy)","Accept is a risk-response strategy that is applicable both for negative (threats) and positive (opportunities) risks. In the case of threats, there are two possible reactions, i.e. passive acceptance (no special action is planned, just continue to monitor the risk) or active acceptance, which implies the development of a contingency plan. In the case of opportunities, no specific action is taken towards realizing them. We simply benefit from them in the case where they occur."
Acceptance,"Acceptance is the act of approving (signing-off) deliverables if they meet the defined acceptance criteria. It is the Project Owner (PO) who accepts the deliverables, during or at the end of the Executing Phase (deliverables acceptance) and during the Closing Phase (final project acceptance)."
Acceptance Criteria,"Acceptance criteria comprise the prioritised list of requirements that the final deliverables must meet before the Project Owner (PO) can accept them.
Acceptance criteria are documented in the Deliverables Acceptance Management Plan."
Accountable Role (RASCI table),The accountable role on the RASCI table refers to the person/group/entity that is ultimately answerable for the correct and full completion of the deliverable or task. They delegate the work and approve key milestones and deliverables. There is only one accountable person/group/entity per activity/task.
Achievements,Achievements are the successful accomplishment of project outputs as a result of carrying out project activities.
Activity,"An activity is a set of tasks/work belonging to a process/work package in a project, with measurable outputs and limited duration."
Actual Cost (AC),Actual Cost (AC) is the amount of cost (monetary units) actually incurred until a given point in time (e.g. within a predefined reposting period). Also known as Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP).
Administrative Closure,"Administrative Closure takes place during the Closing Phase of a project. It is the process by which the Project Manager (PM) ensures that the project has been fully and formally accepted by the Project Owner (PO), that all documentation and records are reviewed, organised and securely archived, and that all resources are formally released."
Agile project management,"Agile is a project management approach with a specific set of working principles and practices. It promotes an iterative delivery approach, cooperation of self- organised teams and process adaptability."
Appropriate Governance Body (AGB),The Appropriate Governance Body (AGB) is the entity responsible for the strategic planning and portfolio management at the institution level. It can be set for a specific domain and appear in different stages of the governance process.
Approval,"Approval is the formal acceptance of (i.e. positive decision on) something, such as a deliverable, an artefact, a project change or a risk-response strategy."
Architecture Office (AO),The Architecture Office (AO) advises project teams on architectural aspects (e.g. Application Architecture and IT Systems Architecture) and develops architecture standards for projects.
Artefacts,"Artefacts are tangible outputs of project management activities, such as Project Management Plans, the Project Work Plan, Meeting Minutes, Logs, Checklists, Reports, the Business Case and Project Charter."
Project Manager Assistant (PMA),The Project Manager Assistant (PMA) is an optional PMÂ² role that assists the Project Manager (PM) in project management/administration activities.
Assumption,"An assumption is a hypothesis or piece of unconfirmed information that is considered to be true, and is used in order to proceed with an activity (e.g. project planning). Developing different scenarios that match the various outcomes of an assumption is considered as vital in risk management."
Audit,An audit is an independent evaluation undertaken to provide an appropriate level of assurance as to compliance with given standards.
Authority,"Authority is the right to give orders, make and enforce decisions, apply project resources and sign approvals."
"Avoid
(risk response strategy)","Avoid is a risk-response strategy that consists of changing project conditions, plans, activities or even scope to render the risk irrelevant to the project (i.e. Impact=0 and/or Likelihood=0%)."
