RASCI,"The acronym RASCI (pronounced rasky) stands for: Responsible, Accountable, Supports, Consulted and Informed. It is also known as the Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM). (See also Responsibility Assignment Matrix.)"
Ready for Closing (RfC),"Ready for Closing (RfC) is the third and final phase/approval gate at the end of the Executing Phase, where the Project Steering Committee (PSC) verifies that all planned activities have been carried out, all requirements have been met, and that the project’s output(s) have been fully delivered and accepted by the Business Manager (BM) and the User Representatives (URs)."
Ready for Executing (RfE),"Ready for Executing (RfE) is the second phase/approval gate at the end of the Planning Phase, where the Planning Artefacts are approved by the Project Owner (PO) and the decision is taken to move the project to the Executing Phase."
Ready for Planning (RfP),Ready for Planning (RfP) is the first phase/approval gate at the end of the Initiating Phase. It includes the approval of the Business Case and the Project Charter by the Project Steering Committee (PSC).
Recommendation,A recommendation is the suggested course of action to improve a process/control/output. It is associated with the result of a review/audit.
Reduce (risk response strategy),Reduce is a risk response strategy to mitigate the impact and/or likelihood of a risk through the proactive implementation of risk-reduction activities (e.g. controls) to a level where the residual risk can be accepted.
Requestor Side,"Also referred to as the Client Side. The Requestor Side includes the resources belonging to the organisation that requested the project and where the solution will be delivered. These resources include the Project Owner (PO), the Business Manager (BM) and the Business Implementation Group (BIG)."
Requirement,A requirement is a capability that the product or service the project is designed to deliver needs to have in order to satisfy the stakeholders’ needs. It constitutes an agreement between the customer(s) and the project team on what to produce. It is a test that the end-product of the project has to pass in order to fulfil the customer’s demands.
Residual Risk,The residual risk is a minor accepted risk that remains after the risk-response strategy is implemented or after existing controls are considered.
Resource,"A resource is an asset or object needed to achieve project objectives (e.g. people, budget, software, hardware, facilities, equipment and materials)."
Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM),The Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM) is a way of clarifying roles and responsibilities for an activity and of ensuring that each component of work is assigned to a person or a team. (See also RASCI.)
Responsible Role (RASCI table),"The responsible role on the RASCI table is the person/group/entity that has to perform the tasks or ensure that they are done. Others can support this role (or do part of the work) or be consulted (review or approve the work), but there is only one responsible person/group/entity."
Reviewer,A reviewer is the person who formally assesses and validates an artefact or deliverable.
Risk,"A risk is an uncertain event or set of events (positive or negative) that, should it occur, will have an effect on the achievement of project objectives. A risk is generally measured by a combination of the likelihood (probability of the risk happening) and the size of the impact on the project."
Risk Appetite,Risk appetite describes the level of risk that an organisation is prepared to accept in the pursuit of its objectives.
Risk Assessment,"A Risk Assessment is an evaluation performed by analysing the likelihood of an identified event occurring and the impact on project objectives if this event happens, alongside the risk appetite and existing vulnerabilities of the project/organisation. Risk levels are calculated for each event and risks are then prioritised."
Risk Assessment (Likelihood/Impact) Matrix,A Risk Assessment Matrix shows the different combinations of likelihood and impact of project risks and defines bands of risk level that suggest risk-response strategies.
Risk Impact,"The risk impact describes the potential consequence that the risk will have on the project’s objectives, should it materialise. The impact can be both quantitative and qualitative in nature. It is usually expressed on a scale from 1 to 5."
Risk Likelihood,"The risk likelihood expresses the probability that the risk might occur. It is usually expressed on a scale from 1 to 5 (it call also be expressed in terms of actual probabilities, e.g. 10%-30%-50%-70%-90%)."
Risk Level (RL),The risk level (RL) is the result of the combination of the likelihood (L) that a risk occurs and its impact (I) should it occur. (RL=L*I).
Risk Log,"A Risk Log is the central repository for all risks identified by the project or organisation. It includes information for each risk such as its likelihood, impact, level, risk-response strategies and risk owner. A Risk Log can also be referred to as a Risk Register or Risk List."
Risk Management,"Risk management describes a continuous, proactive and systematic process for identifying, assessing and managing risks in line with the accepted risk levels, carried out throughout the project to provide reasonable assurance as regards the achievement of project objectives."
Risk Management Plan,"The Risk Management Plan defines and documents the risk management process for a project. It describes how risks will be identified and assessed, what tools and techniques will be used, the risk level bands (in the risk assessment matrix), the relevant roles and responsibilities, and how often risks need to be revisited, etc. It also defines the risk monitoring and escalation process as well as the structure of the Risk Log used to document and communicate the risks and the risk-response actions."
Risk Owner,The risk owner is the person accountable for the management and monitoring of a specific risk.
Risk Reserve,The risk reserve refers to the amount of budget or time estimated and allocated to implement project risk-response strategies.
Risk-Response Strategy,"The risk-response strategy describes the way in which a risk will be managed. The risk response strategies are created in order to be able to counter both positive (opportunities) and negative (threats) risks, and are grouped as follows: Threats: Avoid, Reduce, Accept, Transfer/Share Opportunities: Exploit, Enhance, Accept, Share"
Risk Status,"The status of a risk is logged in the Risk Log. It can assume the following values: proposed, investigating, waiting for approval, approved, rejected, closed."
Root Cause,The root cause describes the original/primary cause of an issue or a risk.
