=== Planning Kick-off Meeting

The Planning Phase starts with an official Planning Kick-off Meeting, the aim of which is to:

* ensure that everyone understands the project scope
* clarify the expectations of all key project stakeholders
* identify project risks
* discuss the project plans.

At this early stage, past experiences, and especially Lessons Learned from previous similar projects, will significantly help the project team.

This Planning Kick-off Meeting should be planned and run effectively as it is critical that the project goals are well understood.
PMÂ² provides templates for the Meeting Agenda and the Minutes of Meeting (MoM).
