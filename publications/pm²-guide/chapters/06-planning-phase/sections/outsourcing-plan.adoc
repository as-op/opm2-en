=== Outsourcing Plan

The Outsourcing Plan defines the _what_ and _how_ for any outsourced products or services.
It outlines the scope of products and/or services to be purchased or contracted, identifies the outsourcing strategies that will be used, and defines the relevant responsibilities for the full outsourcing lifecycle.
Note that the present plan should be compliant with the relevant organizational rules and procedures.

==== Steps
[arabic]
. Identify the deliverables and activities that need to be outsourced, along with the timeframe within which the outsourcing should take place.
. Decide who can interface with the contractors and who is responsible for signing the contract.
Note that there might be organisation-level rules on contracting to be followed.
. List the evaluation criteria for contractors.
This ensures that a contractor is selected on the basis of pre-set criteria and that no single person or group influences the decision.
The criteria could include the following: capability, previous experience in similar projects, anything else of relevance.
. Identify any constraints that may affect the outsourcing process (an organisationâ€™s pre-existing agreements or preferred suppliers may require the project team to work with specific suppliers or contractors).
. Identify the method(s) by which new products may be obtained (i.e. lease/purchase, tendering process). Factors like time/capacity constraints may also influence the choice of method.
. Identify the people within the organisation who must approve purchases.
. Provide a timeline for all the contracted activities and deliverables.
This will ensure that the contractor is committed to having resources available to meet the pre-agreed timeline.
. Identify any documentation deliverables expected from the contractors (e.g. manuals, etc.).
