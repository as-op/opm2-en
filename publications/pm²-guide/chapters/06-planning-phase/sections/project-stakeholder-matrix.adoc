=== Project Stakeholder Matrix

The Project Stakeholder Matrix lists all (key) project stakeholders and their contact details and clearly states their role(s) in the project.
It may also include a classification or categorisation of each stakeholder.
The information captured in the Project Stakeholder Matrix should be tailored to the project’s needs.
