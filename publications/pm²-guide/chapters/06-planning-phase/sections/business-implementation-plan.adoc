=== Business Implementation Plan

The Business Implementation Plan aims to increase the likelihood of achieving the project’s desired outcomes and benefits.
It documents an assessment of the project’s impact on the organisation's processes, culture and people and outlines the change-management and communications activities that need to take place to ensure that the project outputs are effectively integrated into the organisation’s environment.

Depending on the organization, the business implementation activities can be performed as part of the same project or as a separate one.
These activities become part of the Project Work Plan and are scheduled and controlled as part of the overall project.
