=== Transition Plan

The Transition Plan defines the goals, prerequisites, activities and responsibilities associated with transitioning from the old (pre-project) to the new (post-project) state.
It seeks to minimise the impact of any disruptions on the business during the transition period, and to facilitate the roll-out of project outputs in a smooth and timely fashion, allowing them to be used efficiently and with no serious transition issues.

A successful transition is an important prerequisite for achieving the planned project benefits.
All transition activities become part of the Project Work Plan and are scheduled and controlled as part of the overall project.
