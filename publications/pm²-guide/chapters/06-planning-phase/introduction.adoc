== Planning Phase

The second phase of a PM² project is the Planning Phase.
It begins with the Planning Kick-off Meeting and ends once all project plans have been developed and baselined, and an appropriate management and implementation approach has been established.
Most of a project’s artefacts are created during the Planning Phase.
