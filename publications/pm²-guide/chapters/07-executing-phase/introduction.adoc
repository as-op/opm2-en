== Executing Phase

The third phase of a PM² project is the Executing Phase.
During this phase, the project deliverables are produced and the requestor organisation prepares for their introduction.
The Executing Phase begins with a Kick-off Meeting and ends with the acceptance (final or provisional—as per the Deliverables Acceptance Plan) by the requestor side.
