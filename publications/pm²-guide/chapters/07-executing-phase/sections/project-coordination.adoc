=== Project Coordination

The objective of project coordination is to facilitate the projectâ€™s progress by continuously providing information to the Project Core Team (PCT) and supporting the completion of assigned work.

Project coordination includes allocating project resources to activities, performing regular quality checks of interim results, maintaining ongoing communication with all project team members, and keeping everyone involved in the project motivated through leadership, negotiations, conflict resolution and the application of appropriate Human Resource management techniques.
