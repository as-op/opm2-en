=== Business Case

The purpose of the Business Case is to capture the reasoning behind the project, to describe the project’s alignment with the organisation’s strategic objectives, to provide a justification for the investment in time and effort, and to set out the budgetary needs.
For larger strategic projects, the Business Case may also include an assessment of impact and risks along with a more detailed cost-benefit analysis.

The Business Case provides decision-makers with the information they need to determine whether the project is worth doing.
The Business Case is a living document and therefore should be re-examined at critical project milestones to check that the expected benefits are still achievable, the costs/schedule fall within the budget/timeline, and the project is still relevant to the organisation and should be continued.

==== Guidelines
* Note that the form and depth of analysis required for this artefact depends on the level of investment required for the project.
* Consider several solutions that fulfil this business need and recommend one of these.
* Describe the overall approach to how the project will be executed (project strategy).
* Identify measurable criteria that will be used to determine the success of the project.
* For projects carried out under contract (e.g. as a result of a bid award), create the Business Case based on the Request for Proposal, the response to this request, and the contract itself.

==== Steps
[arabic]
. The Business Manager (BM) drafts the Business Case based on the information captured in the Project Initiation Request.
The main project aspects to be analysed and presented are:
    * the project’s justification and impact
    * the project’s positioning in the overall organisational strategy
    * an assessment of Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT Analysis) of several solutions, one of which is proposed for implementation
    * a cost benefit analysis, per identified solution, detailed to the extend required
    * synergies and interdependencies with other projects and initiatives
    * high-level project roadmap, including major milestones.
. The Project Owner (PO) evaluates the Business Case and decides to approve or reject it.
. The Project Owner (PO) sends the Business Case to the Appropriate Governance Body (AGB) if needed for corporate approval.
