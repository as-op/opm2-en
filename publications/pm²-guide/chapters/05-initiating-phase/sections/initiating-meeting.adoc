=== Initiating Meeting

This is an informal meeting, usually between the project initiator and the Project Owner (PO), and others who could potentially contribute to the creation of the Initiating Phase documents.
The goal of this meeting is to introduce any pre-project information and discuss the next steps.

The result of this meeting is a better understanding of the context of the (future) project, as well as a decision to move forward with the creation of the Project Initiation Request.
Documentation and lessons learned from previous similar projects can also be used as input to this meeting.
