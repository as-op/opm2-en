== Initiating Phase

The first phase of a PMÂ² project is the Initiating Phase.
It begins with the identification of a need, problem or opportunity, and ends with the establishment of the plans and processes needed to take the project forward.
Proper project initiation is critical for successful project planning and execution.
It involves defining project objectives and constraints, and receiving formal organisational sponsorship for the project.

Three key project artefacts are created during the Initiating Phase: the Project Initiation Request, the Business Case and the Project Charter.
Some of the Project Logs are also set up (i.e. Risk Log, Issue Log, Decision Log) while the Change Log is typically set up during the Planning Phase.
