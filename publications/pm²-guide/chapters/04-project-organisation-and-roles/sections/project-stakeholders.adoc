=== Project Stakeholders

Project stakeholders are people (or groups) who can affect, be affected by, or believe to be affected by the activities carried out during a project’s lifecycle and/or by its output(s) and outcome(s). Stakeholders can be directly involved in a project’s work, members of other internal organisations or external to the organisation (e.g. contractors, suppliers, users or the general public).

The number of stakeholders depends on the complexity and scope of a project.
However, the more people the project has an impact on, the more likely it is that it will affect people who have some power or influence over the project.
Given that stakeholders can be useful supporters of the project or may choose to block it, the effective management and involvement of them is crucial for its success.
