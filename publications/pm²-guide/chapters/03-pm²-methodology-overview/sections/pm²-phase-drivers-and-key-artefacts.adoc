=== PM² Phase Drivers and Key Artefacts

Projects depend on people to define, plan and execute them.
These project drivers change from phase to phase in a PM² project.

During the Initiating Phase, the Project Owner (PO) is the main driver, initiating the project and being accountable for all documentation.

In the Planning Phase, the main driver is the Project Manager (PM), who is responsible for coordinating the delivery of all project plans.

The carrying out of the Project Work Plan and creation of the project deliverables in the Executing Phase is driven by the Project Core Team (PCT).

Finally, the Closing Phase is driven by the stakeholders who evaluate the project’s overall performance.
