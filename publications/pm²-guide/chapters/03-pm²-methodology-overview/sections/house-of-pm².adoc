=== The House of PM²

The PM² Methodology is built on Project Management best practices and is supported by four pillars:

[arabic]
. a project governance model (i.e. Roles & Responsibilities)
. a project lifecycle (i.e. Project Phases)
. a set of processes (i.e. project management activities)
. a set of project Artefacts (i.e. documentation templates and guidelines).

The spirit of the PM² Methodology is further defined by the PM² Mindsets, which provide the glue that holds together the PM² practices and provide a common set of beliefs and values for PM² project teams.
