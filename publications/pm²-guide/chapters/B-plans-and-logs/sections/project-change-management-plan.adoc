=== Project Change Management Plan

The Project Change Management Plan defines and documents the change process for a project.
It defines the activities, roles and responsibilities related to identifying, documenting, assessing, approving, prioritising, implementing, controlling and communicating requested project changes.

Project change management brings transparency, accountability and traceability to all project changes implemented after the project scope and project plans have been baselined.
The escalation procedure ensures that changes with a significant impact on project performance are properly assessed and approved by the appropriate level of authority.
The Project Change Log is used to document requested changes and trace all related decisions and planned actions.

. Check if there is a pre-existing project change management process at the organisational level.
. Tailor the Project Change Management Plan to the projectâ€™s needs (e.g. define different steps depending on the type of change, its urgency or impact). Create it as a standalone document or as a section within the Project Handbook.
. Ensure that there is no duplication of information contained in other management plans or the Project Handbook (e.g. the escalation procedure).
. Define what is considered to be a change for the project, as well as the possible types of changes.
. Define the artefacts and the tools and techniques that will be used to identify and assess changes (e.g. the Change Request Form or the Project Change Log).
. Define who is responsible for approving changes at the various impact levels, and how this decision is communicated to the rest of the team.
. Tailor the Change Log (if needed) and customise it to reflect any customisations of the Project Change Management Plan (e.g. scales of urgency, change impact and priority).
. Describe the change monitoring and control activities, their frequency and supporting tools and techniques, e.g. review of changes at a predefined frequency based on the Change Log.
. Ensure that the change management process is communicated to the project team and stakeholders.
