=== Issue Management Plan

The Issue Management Plan defines and documents the activities, roles and responsibilities related to identifying, assessing, assigning, resolving and controlling project issues.
Issues are defined as unplanned project-related events that require a project management action.

The issue management process helps the Project Manager (PM) to assess and act upon issues that have a potential impact on project scope, time, cost, quality, risk or stakeholder satisfaction.
Related decisions can be logged in a Decision Log, which brings visibility to decisions and accountability as to how and by whom they are taken, and to whom they should be communicated.

An Issue Log is used to document the identification, evaluation and assignment of issues and to trace all key decisions and planned actions.
It also helps keep track of who is responsible for solving specific issues by a certain deadline.
It brings visibility and accountability as to how issues are acted upon, and ensures that they are properly managed and resolved.

==== Steps
[arabic]
. Check if there is a pre-existing issue management process at the organisational level.
. Tailor the Issue Management Plan to the projectâ€™s needs.
Create it as a standalone document or as a section within the Project Handbook.
. Ensure that there is no duplication of information contained in other management plans or the Project Handbook (e.g. the escalation procedure).
. Define what will be considered an issue for the project and customise the possible issue categories relevant to the project.
. Define all artefacts, tools and techniques that will be used to identify, assess, assign, resolve and monitor issues (e.g. the Issue Log, root cause analysis, etc.).
. Specify how new issues can be identified and their status communicated, and when new and open issues (and pending decisions) can be discussed (e.g. in project Status Meetings).
. Customise the Issue Log to reflect any changes to the scales of urgency, impact and priority.
. Define which issues (depending on their category, urgency and impact) can be handled at the (Project) Management Layer and which ones need to be escalated.
. Describe the issue control activities, their frequency, and supporting tools and techniques (e.g. a review of issues in project Status Meetings based on the Issue Log or Project Status Reports).
. Define how issues will be linked to their source, to related decisions, actions, risks and changes.
. Specify the procedure for updating the Lessons Learned after an issue is resolved.
. Ensure that the issue management process is communicated to the project team and stakeholders.
