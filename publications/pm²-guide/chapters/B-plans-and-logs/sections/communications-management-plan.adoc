=== Communications Management Plan

The Communications Management Plan helps to ensure that all project stakeholders have the information they need to perform their roles throughout the project.
Planning and executing project communication activities is essential for project success.

The Communications Management Plan defines and documents communication activities, their goals, content, format, frequency and audience.
It also defines how to communicate project status and the assignment of activities to the various stakeholders and includes a communication strategy for each key stakeholder, based on their interests, expectations and influence in the project.

. Review the guidelines set out in the Communications Management Plan template to get a better understanding of how to tailor and customise the Communication Management Plan.
. Ensure that there is no duplication of communication activities described in other management plans such as the Quality Management Plan, the Risk Management Plan, etc.
. If certain processes are already described in the Project Handbook (e.g. the escalation process), reference them to avoid duplication and simply document any changes.
. Identify project stakeholder groups based on the Project Stakeholder Matrix.
. When determining the strategy for each communication activity, consider the interests and influence of both internal and external organisations to the project.
. For each target group, determine what information needs to be communicated, and the purpose of the communication.
. Define all artefacts (e.g. Project Reports) and other means to collect, analyse and distribute project information and manage stakeholdersâ€™ expectations.
. Determine the frequency of the communication activities, their format and the media to be used for the communications (e.g. reports, presentations, meetings, emails, calls).
. Determine who will be responsible for each communication activity and describe the expected results.
. Ensure that the communication management plan is communicated to the project stakeholders.
