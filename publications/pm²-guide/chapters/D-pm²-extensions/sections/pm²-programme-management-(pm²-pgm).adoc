=== PM² Programme Management (PM²-PGM)

A programme is a collection of projects aimed towards a common goal which are managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits and control that could not be obtained from managing them individually.

Programmes may also include work outside the scope of the discrete projects in the programme.
Programme management is the process of managing these interrelated projects to better achieve the programme’s objectives and benefits.

The programme management layer interacts with the project management layer in that it initiates and coordinates the projects within the programme.
The programme itself is initiated from the portfolio management layer within the organisation.

==== Programme Lifecycle

A programme has a defined start and end during which all programme activities are performed, and the projects are delivered.
The PM² programme lifecycle has four phases, which are similar but distinct to the PM² project lifecycle: The Initiating Phase, the Planning Phase, the Executing Phase and the Closing Phase.
Throughout the whole life of the programme Monitor & Control activities are performed.

The Executing Phase can also contain several Stages, each one being linked to a major achievement in terms of programme outcome, which enables the realisation of the benefits.

The typical programme management activities performed during each phase go hand-in-hand with a number of programme artefacts.

==== Initiating Phase

The need for a programme and the key stakeholders are identified in the Programme Initiation Request.
Based on the desired benefits and the estimated costs presented in the Programme Business Case, the programme viability is assessed, and a decision is taken on whether to authorise this programme.
If the Programme Business Case is accepted, a Programme Charter is created defining the programme objectives, a high-level roadmap and budget, along with the programme organisation.
During this phase the Programme Logs are also created.


==== Planning Phase

The stakeholders are further analysed in the Programme Stakeholder Matrix, which leads to an adapted way of distributing information defined in the Programme Communication Plan.
The way of working in the programme is documented in the Programme Handbook.
The programme scope and work is broken down in smaller and more manageable chunks, and grouped in several interrelated projects and programme-level activities.
This work is scheduled in the Programme Work Plan, which is closely linked to the various Project Initiation Requests framing the projects within the programme.
During this phase the programme business implementation activities are also planned and documented in the Programme Business Implementation Plan, with a focus on planning necessary organisational changes and on benefits realisation.


==== Executing Phase

The planned projects are initiated and coordinated during this phase, producing their output.
The programme status is regularly reported to management using the Programme Status Report.
Possible programme (and significant project-scope changes) are documented in the Programme Change Log.
As the project outputs are delivered, the programme activities related to organisational change are also implemented, facilitating the realisation of programme benefits.
Finally, when all the projects are completed, and the programme objectives are achieved, the programme can move to the Closing Phase.


==== Closing Phase

The Lessons Learned and Post-Programme Recommendations are formulated in the Programme-End Report, facilitating the sustainability of the realised benefits after the programme has ended.
The programme organisation is disbanded, all resources released, and the programme is closed administratively.


==== Monitor & Control

Throughout the programme duration Monitor & Control activities are performed.
The overall programme performance is monitored, programme-level changes, risks and issues are managed, and any required corrective measures are taken.
In addition, the programme-level business implementation and benefits realisation activities are also managed.
As a result of the Monitor & Control activities, the baselined Programme Work Plan and the Programme Business Implementation Plan may be updated as necessary.

==== Programme Organisation

The *Programme Owner (PgO)* is accountable for the programme’s success, whereas the day-to-day management of the programme is delegated to the Programme Manager (PgM), whose focus is to achieve the programme outcomes.

The *Programme Business Manager (PgBM)* represents the Programme Owner (PgO) on a daily basis within the programme and collaborates closely with the Programme Manager (PgM). The focus of this role is to realise the programme benefits, enabled by the programme outcomes.

The *Programme Steering Committee (PgSC)* comprises the Programme Owner (PgO), Programme Business Manager (PgBM) and *Programme Manager (PgM)*. Other expert roles can participate as needed.
The Programme Steering Committee (PgSC) is responsible for realising the programme’s objectives and benefits.

A programme can also have a temporary *Programme Support Team (PgST)* to provide administrative assistance to the programme and its component projects.
