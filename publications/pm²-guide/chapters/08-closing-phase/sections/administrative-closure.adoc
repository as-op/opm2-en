=== Administrative Closure

The Project Manager (PM) ensures that all project deliverables have been accepted by the relevant stakeholders and, with the help of the Project Support Office (PSO), that all project documentation and records are up-to-date, reviewed, organised and securely archived.
The Project Team is now officially dissolved and all resources are released.

The project is officially closed once all Closing Phase activities are completed and the Project Owner (PO) has approved the project.
Formal project closure brings project mode to an end and allows operations mode to commence.
