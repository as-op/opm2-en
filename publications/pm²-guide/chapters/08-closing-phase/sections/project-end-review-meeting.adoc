=== Project-End Review Meeting

The Project-End Review Meeting launches the Closing Phase of the project after the Executing Phase is deemed complete.
The goal of this meeting is to ensure that project members discuss their experience of the project so that Lessons Learned and best practices can be captured.
Also in this meeting team and contractor performance are evaluated, and ideas and recommendations for post-project work are discussed.
