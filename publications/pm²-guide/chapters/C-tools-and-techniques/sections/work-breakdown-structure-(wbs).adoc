=== Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical division of the project into smaller work components that can be used to assign work or to estimate effort and cost.
A well-made Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) should be easy to understand, be complete, and should facilitate progress monitoring during execution.
Commonly used techniques include breaking down the project by phases or stages, deliverables or outputs, by work packages, or based on the organisation, its departments and business units.

The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) constitutes a good basis for the Project Manager (PM) in assigning different responsibilities to team members.
Each task in the structure can then be further defined: work can be estimated, risks and dependencies can be identified, and resources can be mobilised.
