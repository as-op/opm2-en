=== Lessons Learned

Capturing Lessons Learned is a way of identifying areas for development/improvement within a project for the purpose of helping similar projects avoid certain pitfalls in the future.
Information that can be captured includes Lessons Learned from the management of risks, quality issues, outsourcing or contractor issues, change requests, etc.

The project team can capture ideas through brainstorming sessions, reviewing project reports and logs, sending project questionnaires, etc., during the lifecycle of the project.
The Project Manager (PM) will group and prioritise Lessons Learned in order to understand key potential improvement areas.

To avoid making the same mistakes twice, Lessons Learned should be shared with other project managers.
In some cases, Lessons Learned can lead to process improvements, enhanced checklists and templates, or more effective training courses.
