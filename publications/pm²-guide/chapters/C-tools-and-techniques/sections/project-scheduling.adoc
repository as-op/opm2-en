=== Project Scheduling

Project Scheduling aims to identify dependencies between tasks, to assign resources for each task, to identify task start and end dates, and to work out the overall project duration.

Scheduling can be done for the entire project upfront or for portions thereof, such as individual stages or iterations.
Different scheduling methods and representations can be used: a list of dates/deadlines, a milestone plan, bar charts, network diagrams and linked bar charts (Gantt charts), all of which can be seen complementary to each other.

Once approved, the project schedule is baselined and any further change to the schedule needs to follow the change management process and the corresponding governance arrangements.
