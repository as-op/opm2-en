=== Stakeholder Interest/Influence Matrix (SIIM)

This technique is used to facilitate and document the analysis of the interest and influence of each stakeholder in the project.
It is of utmost importance to know the stakeholders and their relevance for the project in order to identify project champions and possible detractors.
As the document makes reference to people within your organisation, care should be used to keep the information confidential.

*Interest* indicates the level of interest a stakeholder has for the project.
Interest is measured as the degree of enthusiasm displayed by the stakeholder in support of the project.
Stakeholders can be positive, neutral or negative towards the project.

*Influence* indicates the power the stakeholder has over the planning and implementation of activities.
The higher a stakeholderâ€™s power of decision, the higher their influence.
Most often the person(s) who can make decisions on project funding and/or resources has a high influence.
