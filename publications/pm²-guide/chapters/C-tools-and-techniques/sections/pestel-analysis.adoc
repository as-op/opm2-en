=== PESTEL Analysis

The PESTEL Analysis is used to understand how the environment might impact a project or an objective.
PESTEL stands for: Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental and Legal.
A PESTEL analysis helps identify the external factors that influence an organisation, and therefore, could have an impact on the objectives, planning or execution of projects.

This type of analysis is particularly important in the context of business justification and risk management and will feed the process of designing a plan comprehensive enough to identify and tackle potential risk scenarios (threats/opportunities) arising from outside the organisation or project.
