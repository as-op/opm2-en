=== Effort and Cost Estimates

The Effort and Cost Estimates technique derives from the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS): each work item (task) is estimated in terms of effort and cost.
Effort is typically measured in person days or person months.
This work is done in close cooperation with the task owners or other experts within the Project Core Team (PCT), to ensure more precise estimates and buy-in from the team members in charge of executing the work.

A high-quality Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) forms the basis for high-quality estimates.
