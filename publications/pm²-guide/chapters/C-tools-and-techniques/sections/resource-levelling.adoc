=== Resource Levelling

Resource Levelling is a technique used to analyse the unbalanced use of project resources and to resolve conflicts related to resource allocation (i.e. human resources, material or equipment).

Resource Levelling focuses on an efficient/optimal resource allocation in order for the project to be completed within the defined timeline.
Project Managers (PMs) analyse dependencies between projects or activities to ensure that activities can be executed in a timely manner.
Taking into account the identified constraints, Resource Levelling can be performed.
Resource Levelling can for example require the delay of specific tasks until resources are available, resource reallocation etc.
