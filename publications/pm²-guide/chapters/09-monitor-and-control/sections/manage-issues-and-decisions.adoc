=== Manage Issues and Decisions

The Project Manager (PM) manages project issues and decisions.
Issues are identified, evaluated and assigned for resolution to relevant project stakeholders as per the Issue Management process, which can be documented in either an Issue Management Plan or the Project Handbook.
The Issue Log is used to manage project issues, while the Decision Log is used to document all relevant decisions (see Appendix B). Decisions may be implemented by the Project Manager (PM) or escalated to the Project Steering Committee (PSC), depending on their importance.
Note that issues and decisions are often linked to the resolution of other log items (e.g. risks, changes).
