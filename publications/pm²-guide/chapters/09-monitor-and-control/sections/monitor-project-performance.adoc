=== Monitor Project Performance

The purpose of project performance monitoring is to collect information about the state of the project’s progress and overall health.
The Project Manager (PM) tracks the project dimensions of scope, schedule, cost and quality, monitors risks, issues and project change, and forecasts their evolution for the purpose of reporting the overall project progress.

This information is then distributed to relevant stakeholders as per the Communications Management Plan.
