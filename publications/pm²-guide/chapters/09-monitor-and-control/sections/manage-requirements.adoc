=== Manage Requirements

Requirements management is the process of gathering, documenting and validating requirements and managing their implementation and change.
It is a process that runs throughout the project lifecycle and relates to other project management processes, such as quality and change management.

The Requirements Management Process can be tailored and customised to a project’s needs.
It can be documented either in a Requirements Management Plan or in the Project Handbook.
Separate requirements documents are used to specify, categorise and prioritise the requirements.
These can be standalone documents or an annex to the Project Charter.

==== Inputs
* Project Initiation Request, Business Case and Project Charter
* Requirements Management Plan
* Project Stakeholder Matrix

==== Guidelines
* A requirement is a capability that a product or service must have in order to satisfy a stakeholder’s need(s).
* High-level requirements may also be referred to as business requirements, and are usually initially specified in the Project Initiation Request, the Business Case and the Project Charter.
* Adding further detail to the requirements produces lower-level requirements.
These can be described in a variety of formats (e.g. text, use cases or user stories, models, business processes, sketches or graphics, etc.) and are documented in various requirements artefacts.
* The agreed and approved requirements of all stakeholders constitute the project’s baseline scope.
* Any change to the baselined requirements should be made in accordance with the change management process described in the Change Management Plan.
* For each identified requirement, there should be a corresponding test to validate its acceptance.
The test should be documented in the appropriate document (Deliverable Acceptance Plan, Deliverable Acceptance Checklist or Quality Review Checklist).
* Requirements should describe the need not the solution—non-ambiguous terms should be used and technology- or solution-oriented statements should be avoided.
* Even if requirements have been gathered before the project starts, it is still the responsibility of the Project Manager (PM) to ensure they are managed properly.

==== Steps
[arabic]
. *Specify the requirements:* Together with the project stakeholders, gather the project requirements and document them clearly in the Requirements Artefacts.
Structure them by adding relevant metadata.
. *Evaluate the requirements:* The project team assesses the feasibility, consistency and completeness of the requirements, and estimates the effort/costs needed to implement them.
The Project Manager (PM) balances the list of requirements against project constraints (budget, time, etc.) and makes a proposal to the project stakeholders.
. *Approve the requirements:* The Project Manager (PM) and key stakeholders—such as the Project Owner (PO) or Business Manager (BM)—negotiate and agree on the requirements for the project.
. *Monitor the implementation of requirements:* The Project Manager (PM) continuously monitors the Project Core Team’s (PCT) implementation of the requirements, adds new requirements and changes existing ones when needed.
. *Validate the implemented requirements:* When the requirements are implemented, User Representatives (URs) assess if the solution satisfies the initial business need.
Formal acceptance of the project deliverables should comply with the Deliverables Acceptance process.
