=== Control Schedule

The purpose of schedule control is to ensure that project tasks are carried out as scheduled and that project deadlines are met.
The Project Manager (PM) regularly monitors the schedule and tracks the difference between planned, actual and forecast activities/deadlines.

Approved project changes (e.g. addition of new tasks or changes to the required effort or start/end dates of existing ones) that have an impact on the overall project schedule are incorporated into the Project Work Plan (updated schedule). If the schedule is at risk or considerable delays are foreseen (beyond the predefined thresholds), the Project Steering Committee (PSC) needs to be informed and corrective actions must be devised, agreed and implemented.
If this happens, affected project stakeholders should also be notified.
