=== Manage Project Change

Project change management defines the activities related to identifying, documenting, assessing, prioritising, approving, planning and controlling project changes, as well as communicating them to all relevant stakeholders.
Changes can be requested (or identified and raised) throughout the project lifecycle by any project stakeholder.

The Project Change Management Process can be tailored and customised to a project’s needs and can be documented either in a Project Change Management Plan or in the Project Handbook.
A Change Log is used to document, monitor and control all project changes (see Appendix B). This makes it easier to track the changes and communicate them to the Project Owner (PO) and/or the Project Steering Committee (PSC) for approval.

==== Steps
[arabic]
. *Identify the change:* The purpose of this step is to identify and document change requests.
The Project Manager (PM) ensures that a Change Request is appropriately documented (i.e. via a Change Request Form and in the Change Log).
. *Assess the change and recommend action:* The purpose of this step is to a) assess whether this request is indeed a project change, b) consider the impact of not implementing the proposed change, c) estimate the size of the identified change based on its impact on the project objectives, schedule, cost and effort, and d) prioritise the implementation of the change request in relation to other change requests.
. *Approve the change:* The purpose of this step is to reach a decision regarding the approval of the change based on the project’s escalation procedure (i.e. the change must be reviewed by the appropriate decision-makers within the Managing/Directing/Steering Layers as defined by the project’s Governance Model). There are four possible decisions: approve, reject, postpone or merge the change request.
The decision details are documented in the Change Log and communicated to the requestor.
. *Implement the change:* For approved or merged changes, the Project Manager (PM) should incorporate all related actions into the Project Work Plan and update the related documentation and logs (i.e. Risk, Issue, Change and Decision Logs and other plans).
. *Control the change:* The purpose of this step is to monitor and control project changes so they can be easily communicated to the various project layers for approval or status updates.
The Project Manager (PM) collects information on any project changes and related actions and controls the status of each change management activity.

All stakeholders affected by the project changes should be informed and the Change Log should be kept up-to-date.
