=== Manage Quality

Project quality management aims to ensure that the project will achieve the expected results in the most efficient way and that deliverables will be accepted by the relevant stakeholders.
It involves overseeing all the activities needed to maintain a desired level of excellence.
This includes performing quality planning, quality assurance, quality control and quality improvement throughout the project until the Closing Phase and the final acceptance of the project.
Configuration management helps project stakeholders manage project artefacts and deliverables effectively by providing a single reliable reference to these artefacts and deliverables, thereby ensuring that the correct versions are delivered to the project requestor/client.

The Project Manager (PM) must ensure that the objectives, approach, requirements, activities, metrics and responsibilities of the quality management process are clearly defined and documented in the Quality Management Plan.
