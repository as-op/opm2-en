=== Manage Business Implementation

The effective execution of all business implementation activities is critical for smooth operations, even after the project’s outputs have been delivered to the stakeholder/user community.
Business implementation activities are thus complementary to transition activities.

Note that business implementation activities will almost always be required long after the project has ended, so it is good practice to also define post-project change activities.
The implementation of these activities is the responsibility of the permanent organisation and they are usually carried out as part of ongoing operations or future projects.

. Ensure that all business implementation activities within the scope of the project are included in the Project Work Plan (i.e. are defined and scheduled, with the resources they require estimated).
. Focus on the project business implementation activities, that is, those activities that will be implemented during the project’s duration and clearly fall under the project’s budget and control.
. Manage the execution of all (project) business implementation activities:
* Redesign, adapt or update any affected business processes.
* Implement the communication activities defined in the Business Implementation Plan.
* Implement the planned organisational change management activities.
* Ensure that all training activities are completed.
* Manage business continuity plans for business-critical systems.
. Report on the status of business implementation activities, including any changes.
