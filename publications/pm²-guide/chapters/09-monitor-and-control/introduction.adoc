== Monitor & Control

Monitor & Control activities run throughout the duration of the project, but peak during the Executing Phase.
All project management processes are executed as part of the Monitor & Control process group.

The Monitor & Control activities are carried out based on the processes described in the Project Management Plans developed during the Planning Phase.
The effective execution of these processes is ultimately the responsibility of the Project Manager (PM).

=== Manage
* Execute all management processes defined in the Project Management Plans, and manage the outsourcing, transition, business implementation and deliverables acceptance activities as per the relevant Project Specific Plans.

=== Monitor
* Monitor project activities and overall project performance.
* Track the project performance against the baseline in order to facilitate reporting and controlling.

=== Control
* Devise, plan, propose and implement corrective actions to address existing or potential performance risks or issues, while updating the relevant project plans and logs.

Monitor & Control artefacts comprise the Project Work Plan as well as a range of Project Logs and Checklists.

The *Project Logs* are regularly updated as new information becomes available (e.g. new issues can arise and new information can be added to the Issue Log).

There are several *Checklists* that can be used to help the Project Manager (PM) control the project better.

*PMÂ² provides the following Checklists:*

* Phase-exit Review Checklist
* Quality Review Checklist
* Deliverables Acceptance Checklist
* Transition Checklist
* Stakeholders Checklist
* Business Implementation Checklist
